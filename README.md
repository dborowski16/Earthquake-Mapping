# Introduction
The goal of this particular project was to source data from the USGS regarding earthquakes, their location, magnitude, and depth, etc., and to create a map visualization of that data for the end user.  The map should be such that it conveys the information in a way that tells magnitude by size of the dots, color, and opacity.  In this example, the data used from the USGS are 7 days worth of data, updated every minute.   

# Tools
In order the produce the interactive site, the following tools were used:
- JavaScript
- Leaflet
- HTML to build the front end for visualization

# End Users
The idea of tracking the earthquake locations throughout the world could be benificial to those who are responsible for emergency response and first aid.  This could also be of benefit for people who are looking to relocate and are concerened about techtonic acitivity in the area of interest.
